# Scientist-Beginner-Guide-to-Python

This is an introduction guide for scientists and engineers to learn Python so they can begin to use Python and its numerous library as a tool for their own research projects. 

By the end of this guide, I hope one knows:

<ul>
	<li>The basics of coding in Python and the popular science libraries used today </li>
	<li>How to build their own tools for reduction, visualization, and analyzing data </li>
	<li>How to manage and manipulate large datatables/sets </li>
	<li>How to automate certain aspects of their project </li>
</ul>
among other things. This guide is **NOT** a introduction to computer science or object orientated programming (OOP). When certain situations arises I will give my (very limited) knowledge of CS or OOP to discuss ways code can be more effiecent, but do not expect an in-depth discussion. This will also not go into detail about creating, editing, and scanning text files (unless they are data tables) as I feel it is outside the scope of this guide.

I will assumes zero knowledge of any prior coding experience and I will try my best to explain concepts as clearly and concise as possible. 


# Setting Up Your Device
This guide will be composed of Jupyter Notebooks so it is necessary to install and set up both Python and Jupyter on your device. The easiest way to install them simutaneously is by installing <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>, a distribution of Python. Anaconda also comes with many of the commonly used libraries such as matplotlib and numpy so this mitigates any hiccups that come up later down the line. If you follow the link above, it will take you to Anaconda's homepage and from there you need to navigate to the Download Page. Once you reach that page, select your operating system, download the appropriate file (**SELECT PYTHON 3.X**, there are slight syntax differences between Python 2 and Python 3 which will raise errors if you install the earlier version), and start the installation process.
